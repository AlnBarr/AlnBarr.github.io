## Who am I

Identity is important. I well remember attending events where I was introduced to  retired people "This is John, he used to be a teacher""Hi I am Liz, I used to be a nurse". I am sure you have had similar experiences. Even conference speakers are introduced in this way. "We welcome Fred who was C.E.O of 'Big News Company'". 

I don't know about you but I never want to think of my self as someone how used to be a person but is now defined by the past, as if
the present didn't matter.
