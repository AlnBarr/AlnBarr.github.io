## Who am I

Identity is important. I well remember attending events where I was introduced to  retired people "This is John, he used to be a teacher", "Hi I am Liz, I used to be a nurse". I am sure many of you have had similar experiences. Even conference speakers are introduced in this way. "We welcome Fred who was C.E.O of 'Big News Company'". 

I don't know about you but I never want to think of my self as someone who used to be a person but is now defined by the past, as if
the present didn't matter. I am not defined by what I used to do or who I used to be.

#### Identity really matters!

My identity is important, it is in a small part who others think I am but most importsntly it is who I think I am.

*Why, then, 'tis none to you, for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison. Well, then it isn't one to you, since nothing is really good or bad in itselfâ€”it's all what a person thinks about it.* Hamlet Act 2 scene 2.

Shakespeare had it right. If I see retirement as the end of my useful life then that is what it will be. If I see retirement as an oppourtuinity to grow and try new things then that is what it will be. If I retire at 66 and manage to live an active life until I am 86 that is 20 years when I can contribute, laugh, dance, code, travel, eat, hugg. 

Of course I might not have 20 years, but 30 year old Alan didn't know he would have 30 years ahead of him when he said "I will" at St Edmunds Church Roundhay in 1990. None of us know what tomorrow brings but if I get my preperation right I could well have my best years still ahead of me. At least I am going to assume I have and start planning an active exciting retirement now.
