## Who am I

Identity is important. I well remember attending events where I was introduced to  retired people "This is John, he used to be a teacher", "Hi I am Liz, I used to be a nurse". I am sure many of you have had similar experiences. Even conference speakers are introduced in this way. "We welcome Fred who was C.E.O of 'Big News Company'". 

I don't know about you but I never want to think of my self as someone who used to be a person but is now defined by the past, as if
the present didn't matter. I am not defined by what I used to do or who I used to be.
